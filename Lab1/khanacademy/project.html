        <h2 id="Welcome">Hawaiʻi Welcomes You</h2>
        <p>Let us be the first to say aloha and e kipa mai <strong class="strong">(welcome) to The Hawaiian Islands</strong>. Before you make your journey to <em>Hawaiʻi</em>, use the information featured in this section to plan your trip and make the most of your time here, from entry requirements and how to get around to weather conditions and resources for travelers with disabilities.</p>
        
        <h2>The Island of Molokaʻi</h2>

        <p>Undeveloped and often overlooked, <strong class="strong">Molokaʻi</strong> offers some of the most unique experiences of any of the Hawaiian Islands. <em>Spanning 38 miles long and 10 miles across at its widest point, this island – the fifth largest in Hawaii – <strong class="strong">is home to the world’s tallest sea cliffs, the longest waterfall in the Islands and one of the state’s largest white-sand beaches, Papohaku Beach.</strong></em> 

There are no big resorts or traffic lights here; instead, you’ll find the windswept Moʻomomi Dunes, the 2,744-acre Kamakou Preserve with its unique montane bog, and the secluded Kalaupapa Peninsula, once an isolated community of patients with Hansen’s disease. Stop at Kanemitsu Bakery in Kaunakakai for freshly made Molokaʻi sweet bread right out of the oven.</p>
